## Raison d'être

This website is a way to _express myself artistically_ and technically; _much like a blank canvas._
<br />

Despite not being a designer, I have a keen interest in visual arts; pursuing _beauty and functionality_ is my goal.

## Intrinsics

Before sperging out about the technicalities, I'd like to mention my _biggest inspirations_ for this website;

- [Igor Bedesqui](https://igorbedesqui.com) for ["Schrodinger's Minimalism"](https://igorbedesqui.com/writing/schrodinger-minimalism)
- [Feáim Pacífica](https://fea.monster) for her constant feedback, inspiration, and support
- [Devine Lu Linvega](https://xxiivv.com/) for their visual arts and approach to documentation

### Typefaces

- [Aileron](https://dotcolon.net/font/aileron/) by Sora Sagano for paragraphs
- [Medio](https://dotcolon.net/font/medio/) by Sora Sagano for headings

### Colours

- [ ]{.circle .white} White Background
- [ ]{.circle .primrose} Primrose Accent
- [ ]{.circle .silver} Silver Paragraph
- [ ]{.circle .black} Black Highlight
- [ ]{.circle .dune} Dune Heading

### Tooling

The website is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and plain _HTML, CSS, and JavaScript_; leveraging [Three.js](https://threejs.org) for 3D graphics.  
<br />

Blog posts are _hackily converted_ from markdown to HTML using a custom Vite plugin, which also _injects hashed assets_ into the HTML files by parsing the Vite manifest.

## Ad futurum

> _A Latin phrase_ meaning "for the future."

<br />

I plan to build a _knowledge base_ by documenting my projects, thoughts, and experiences; as well as a _portfolio_ showcasing my artistic and technical endeavours.  
<br />

Over the years, I'd like for this website to become a _time capsule of my growth and development_; a reflection of my past, present, and future self.
