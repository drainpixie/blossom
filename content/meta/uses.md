# DELL Latitude 5490

Colloquially known as _timeline_, she's its primary—and currently, only—computer. The specifics are as follows:

- Intel® Core™ i5-8250U (8) @ 3.40 GHz
- Intel UHD Graphics 620 @ 1.10 GHz
- 12GB SODIMM 2400 MT/s DDR4
- 512GB M.2 PCIe SSD

Her display is horrible, the battery isn't great, and she's rather bulky, but she performs _wonderfully_ well. It can't complain, as it doesn't require particularly high performance.  
<br />

Some of the other software it runs _specifically_ on her:

- [NixOS](@/tech/nix-love-hate.md), as it has spoken about before.
- [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to maintain its user environments.
- [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) because it has found peace in floating-based workflows and simplicity.

# iPhone 13

Colloquially known as _nullptr_, she's its main phone and its most beloved; coming from a history of Android devices, she was probably the best change it ever made in its workflow.

- _Apple Calendar_ & _Reminders_ are extremely well-made and help it immensely in completing tasks in a timely manner—or at all.
- _Apple Health_ is the most comprehensive and easy-to-use app it's found for tracking its health (mostly, but not exclusively, medication).
- [Paperback](https://paperback.moe/) is essentially the same as above but for man{ga, hua, hwa}.
- [Aldiko](https://www.demarque.com/en/aldiko) whenever it can't read a book physically, as it connects to its OPDS server.
- _Chrome_ over _Safari_—this might change if it ever gets a MacBook.
- [Raivo](https://raivo-otp.com/) for all its OTP needs.
- [An Otter RSS](https://anotterrss.com/) for all its RSS needs.

# Hardware

Hopefully, it will be able to add a few PSPs and new 3DS XLs to this list.

- _Moondrop Chu II_ (IEMs)
- _Nintendo DSi XL_ (Burgundy)
- _Nintendo DSi_ (Red)
- _Nintendo 2DS_ (Pokémon Red Groudon)
- _PlayStation 4_ (Slim)

<br />

# Software

- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for the same reasons as GNOME, although it has wanted to work on its own shell for a while.
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for everything that isn't overly complex web development slop.
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), which isn't its terminal of choice, but it has been too lazy to write a derivation for its [st](https://st.suckless.org/) build.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)—there isn't a real alternative, however much it would like to appease the average Linux user. Firefox is hot garbage, Ungoogled Chromium lacks account features and is shady, and everything in between is barely worth a glance.
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), because setting up WireGuard—or worse, OpenVPN—from scratch is incredibly annoying.
- Non-exhaustive CLI amenities: [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide), [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv), [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), [koji](https://github.com/cococonscious/koji), [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei), [strace](https://github.com/strace/strace), [dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust).
