# DELL Latitude 5490

Colloquially known as _timeline_, she's my primary—and currently, only—computer. The specifics are as follows:

- Intel® Core™ i5-8250U (8) @ 3.40 GHz
- Intel UHD Graphics 620 @ 1.10 GHz
- 12GB SODIMM 2400 MT/s DDR4
- 512GB M.2 PCIe SSD

Her display is horrible, the battery isn't great, and she's rather bulky, but she performs _wonderfully_ well. I can't complain, as I don't require particularly high performance.  
<br />

Some of the other software I run _specifically_ on her:

- [NixOS](@/tech/nix-love-hate.md), as I have spoken about before.
- [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to maintain my user environments.
- [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) because I found peace in floating-based workflows and simplicity.

# iPhone 13

Colloquially known as _nullptr_, she's my main phone and my most beloved; coming from a history of Android devices, she was probably the best change I have ever made in my workflow.

- _Apple Calendar_ & _Reminders_ are extremely well-made and help me immensely in completing tasks in a timely manner—or at all.
- _Apple Health_ is the most comprehensive and easy-to-use app I have found for tracking its health (mostly, but not exclusively, medication).
- [Paperback](https://paperback.moe/) is essentially the same as above but for man{ga, hua, hwa}.
- [Aldiko](https://www.demarque.com/en/aldiko) whenever I can't read a book physically, as it connects to my OPDS server.
- _Chrome_ over _Safari_—this might change if I ever get a MacBook.
- [Raivo](https://raivo-otp.com/) for all my OTP needs.
- [An Otter RSS](https://anotterrss.com/) for all my RSS needs.

# Hardware

Hopefully, I will be able to add a few PSPs and new 3DS XLs to this list.

- _Moondrop Chu II_ (IEMs)
- _Nintendo DSi XL_ (Burgundy)
- _Nintendo DSi_ (Red)
- _Nintendo 2DS_ (Pokémon Red Groudon)
- _PlayStation 4_ (Slim)

<br />

# Software

- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for the same reasons as GNOME, although I want to work on my own shell.
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for everything that isn't overly complex web development slop.
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), which isn't my terminal of choice, but I have been too lazy to write a derivation for my [st](https://st.suckless.org/) build.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)—there isn't a real alternative, however much I would like to appease the average Linux user. Firefox is shady hot garbage, Ungoogled Chromium lacks account features, and everything in between is barely worth a glance.
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), because setting up WireGuard—or worse, OpenVPN—from scratch is incredibly annoying.
- Non-exhaustive CLI amenities: [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide), [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv), [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), [koji](https://github.com/cococonscious/koji), [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei), [strace](https://github.com/strace/strace), [dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust).
