## Raison d’être

This website serves as a way for it to _express itself artistically_ and technically — _much like a blank canvas._\
<br />

Despite not being a designer, it has a keen interest in visual arts; pursuing _beauty and functionality_ is its goal.

## Intrinsics

Before delving into the technicalities, it would like to mention its _biggest inspirations_ for this website:\
<br />

- [Igor Bedesqui](https://igorbedesqui.com) for [“Schrödinger’s Minimalism”](https://igorbedesqui.com/writing/schrodinger-minimalism)
- [Feáim Pacífica](https://fea.monster) for her constant feedback, inspiration, and support
- [Devine Lu Linvega](https://xxiivv.com/) for their visual arts and approach to documentation

### Typefaces

- [Sono](https://github.com/sursly/sono) by Ty Finck for codeblocks
- Default system font for paragraphs and headings

### Colours

- <div class="circle white"></div> White Background
- <div class="circle primrose"></div> Primrose Accent
- <div class="circle silver"></div> Silver Paragraph
- <div class="circle black"></div> Black Highlight
- <div class="circle dune"></div> Dune Heading

### Tooling

The website is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and plain _HTML, CSS, and JavaScript_, leveraging the customisation of Zola’s templates for the design.\
<br />

It uses Zola’s powerful taxonomies and templates to generate the “digital garden” of the website.

## Ad futurum

> _A Latin phrase_ meaning “for the future.”

<br />

It plans to build a _knowledge base_ by documenting its projects, thoughts, and experiences, as well as a _portfolio_ showcasing its artistic and technical endeavours.\
<br />

Over the years, it hopes for this website to become a _time capsule of its growth and development_—a reflection of its past, present, and future self.
