We finally did it… It did its first shot of `\1` on `\1`.  
This will serve as a way to `\1` its effects and its journey through transition.  
<br />

## The First Shot – `\1`  

It was an overwhelming experience. Understanding how needles and their sizes work, determining the correct injection site, and drawing the right dosage all felt daunting.  
<br />

It made mistakes. It failed to draw correctly, mistakenly tried to push the `0.2mL` air bubble into the `\1` rather than the vial, and struggled to understand why the liquid would not fill the syringe.  
<br />

It also used the wrong-sized needle for drawing—the `23G` instead of the `18G`—and in the process of switching needles, pricked its finger. The sight of blood was unpleasant, but in hindsight, the mistake was avoidable. Only then did it realise that simply capping and twisting the needle off would have sufficed.  
<br />

It owes much to `\1` for guiding it through the process. Overcome with anxiety, it had considered giving up entirely.  
<br />

The most difficult part was the preparation. The injection itself, by contrast, was almost calming.  
<br />

It wiped the injection site (`\1`, 90-degree angle), pressed the plunger until a droplet of liquid formed at the needle tip, and then proceeded.  
<br />

The needle went in, the dose was delivered, and it was over.  
<br />

There was no pain—only a small amount of blood. It wiped the area again, applied a `\1`, and the process was complete.  

## The Day After – `\1`  

It feels unusual. Initially, it assumed its elevated mood was a placebo effect or the result of `\1`. However, the stability and consistency of this improvement suggest otherwise. It has felt remarkably well throughout the day, an anomaly in its experience.  
<br />

There was also mild fatigue—nothing severe, but notable given that it is a known side effect.  

## Unexpected Realisation – `\1`  

It discovered that `\1`, a medication it has been prescribed, may accelerate the metabolism of oestradiol, potentially reducing its effectiveness. This revelation was unsettling.  
<br />

It has since contacted its psychiatrist to discuss the matter.
